-- Lab | SQL Queries 5
-- In this lab, you will be using the Sakila database of movie rentals. You have been using this database for a couple labs already, but if you need to get the data again, refer to the official installation link.
-- The database is structured as follows:

-- 1. Drop column picture from staff.
USE sakila;

ALTER TABLE staff DROP column picture;

-- check de que lo quite:
SELECT * FROM sakila.staff;

-- 2. A new person is hired to help Jon. Her name is TAMMY SANDERS, and she is a customer. Update the database accordingly.

INSERT INTO sakila.staff (
	staff_id,
	first_name,
	last_name,
	address_id,
	email,
	store_id,
	`active`,
	username,
	`password`,
	last_update
)
VALUES (
	3,
    "TAMMY",
    "SANDERS",
    (SELECT address_id FROM sakila.customer WHERE first_name="TAMMY" AND last_name="SANDERS"),
    (SELECT email FROM sakila.customer WHERE first_name="TAMMY" AND last_name="SANDERS"),
	(SELECT store_id FROM sakila.customer WHERE first_name="TAMMY" AND last_name="SANDERS"),
    (SELECT `active` FROM sakila.customer WHERE first_name="TAMMY" AND last_name="SANDERS"),
    "TAMMY",
    "Hola soy Tammy",
    CURDATE()
);


-- 3. Add rental for movie "Academy Dinosaur" by Charlotte Hunter from Mike Hillyer at Store 1. 
-- You can use current date for the rental_date column in the rental table. Hint: Check the columns in the table rental and see what information you would need to add there. 
-- You can query those pieces of information. For eg., you would notice that you need customer_id information as well. To get that you can use the following query:

SELECT 
    *
FROM
    sakila.rental;
INSERT INTO sakila.rental (
    rental_date,
	inventory_id,
	customer_id,
	return_date,
	last_update,
    staff_id
)
VALUES (
    CURDATE(),
    (SELECT inventory_id FROM sakila.inventory WHERE film_id IN (SELECT film_id FROM sakila.film WHERE title="Academy Dinosaur") AND store_id IN (SELECT store_id FROM sakila.customer WHERE first_name = 'CHARLOTTE' and last_name = 'HUNTER')LIMIT 1),
    (select customer_id from sakila.customer where first_name = 'CHARLOTTE' and last_name = 'HUNTER'),
    null,
	CURDATE(),
    (SELECT staff_id FROM sakila.staff WHERE store_id IN (SELECT store_id FROM sakila.customer WHERE first_name = 'CHARLOTTE' and last_name = 'HUNTER')LIMIT 1)
);

-- 4. Delete non-active users, but first, create a backup table deleted_users to store customer_id, email, and the date for the users that would be deleted. Follow these steps:

-- Check if there are any non-active users
-- Create a table backup table as suggested
-- Insert the non active users in the table backup table
-- Delete the non active users from the table customer

SELECT 
customer_id, active
FROM 
sakila.customer
WHERE 
active=0;

CREATE TABLE 
deleted_users (
    customer_id INT,
    email VARCHAR(255),
    delete_date DATE
);
INSERT INTO deleted_users (customer_id, email, delete_date)
SELECT customer_id, email, CURDATE() FROM customer WHERE active = 0;

DELETE FROM sakila.customer WHERE active = 0;
DELETE FROM sakila.payment WHERE customer_id IN (SELECT customer_id FROM customer WHERE active = 0);
SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS = 0;
DELETE FROM customer WHERE active = 0;


SELECT 
customer_id, active
FROM 
sakila.customer
WHERE 
active=0;
